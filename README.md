## Getting Started üöÄ

Before diving into the projects, make sure you have the following tools and dependencies installed on your machine:

1. **Golang:** Ensure you have Golang installed on your machine. You can download it from [Golang Official Website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. **PostgreSQL:** The projects might involve database interactions. Install PostgreSQL and set up a database. You can download it from [PostgreSQL Official Website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

   - **Example Connection String:**
     ```bash
     postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name?sslmode=disable
     ```
     Make sure to replace `username`, `password`, and `database_name` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

3. **MailHog:** To simulate email interactions, use MailHog. Download and install it from [MailHog GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/releases).

4. **DBeaver:** For database management and visualization, DBeaver is a handy tool. Download it from [DBeaver Official Website](https://dbeaver.io/download/).

5. **Soda/Pop from Buffalo:** If you are dealing with migrations, Soda (or Pop) is a powerful tool from the Buffalo framework. Find more information on [Buffalo Pop Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gobuffalo/pop).

   - **Installation:**
     ```bash
     go get -u github.com/gobuffalo/pop/...
     ```

6. **Foundation for Email Templates:** For email templates, you can use the Foundation framework. Check out the available templates at [Foundation Email Templates](https://get.foundation/emails/email-templates.html).

7. **Simple DataTables for Admin Dashboard:** For a clean table in the Admin Dashboard, consider using Simple DataTables. Get started with DataTables at [Simple DataTables GitHub](https://github.com/fiduswriter/simple-datatables).

   - **Example Integration:**
     ```html
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-datatables@latest/dist/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-datatables@latest" type="text/javascript"></script>
     ```

8. **Database Configuration:**
   - Copy the `database-example.yml` file to `database.yml`.
   - Open `database.yml` and fill in the details for the `development` environment.

      ```yaml
      development:
        dialect: postgres
        database: bookings
        user: YOUR_POSTGRES_USER
        password: YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
        host: 127.0.0.1
        pool: 5
      ```

9. **Soda Migrate Commands:**
   - **Run Migrations:**
     ```bash
     soda migrate up
     ```
   - **Generate a New Migration:**
     ```bash
     soda generate fizz MyNewMigration
     ```
   - **Rollback Last Migration:**
     ```bash
     soda migrate down
     ```

Now you're all set! Clone this repository to your local environment, navigate to the specific project directory you want to explore, and start tinkering, experimenting, and learning!

Feel free to customize the database connection string, email templates, DataTables integration, and database configuration based on your preferences and project requirements.

Happy coding! üöÄ
